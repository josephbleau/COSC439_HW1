This document outlines the simple plaintext flight server request protocol.

	Server is run on port 50398, client may use any port.

0. Message buffer is 1024bytes, any message which is truncated will be continued 
   in a new message that begins with "CONT,", this will probably only happen when
   the client requests the flight list (assuming we have a lot of flights entered.)

1. All data is sent in plaintext.

2. All requests and responses end with |

3. All messages, either from or to the server must begin with the relevant Flight ID.
3.a. The only exception to this is in requesting and returning the list of available
     flights.

4. All requests are comma delimited, spaces are ignored.

6. Below are the following functions available to the client in the form of
   the message they must send.
	
	FLIGHTLIST| to which the server will respond with a comma delimited list of
	available flight IDs.


	[FLIGHTID], DETAILS|

		Returns a comma delimited list containing: 
			Flight ID, Premium Capacity, Available Prem. Seats, 
			Economy Capacity, Available Economy Seats

	[FLIGHTID], [PURCHASEPREM|PURCHASEECON], [NUMBER OF SEATS]|

		This requests a purchase. The server will respond with:

		[FLIGHTID], PURCHASERESPONSE, SUCCESS| on a successful transaction
		
		or	

		[FLIGHTID],PURCHASERESPONSE,FAILURE,[NUMBER OF SEATS LEFT]| when
		there aren't enough seats to fufill the request it will return
		failure and the number of seats available.
